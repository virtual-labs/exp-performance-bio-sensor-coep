Perform the experiments using Simulator. Click on Simulator tab.
 
### Level 1: Calibration of the probe

#### Aim: To study the calibration of given source-sensor probe
##### Step by step Procedure:

1. Click on Calibration Tab.
2. You are provided with a circular disc having 60 equally spaced holes on its periphery.
3. The disc is connected to a DC motor. The speed of the motor can be adjusted in steps of 0.5 rpm upto 2 rpm.
4. Select the speed by using drop down tab.
5. Click on Start Rotation Tab.
6. The disk will start rotating. The BPM (Bits per minute) are indicated on the display.
7. Repeat the procedure for different speed if necessary.
8. Now level 2 tab will be enabled. Click on level 2 tab.

### Level 2: Measure the pulse using given source-sensor probe

#### Aim: To measure the pulse rate using given source-sensor probe

##### Step by step Procedure:

1. Select the patient age by using drop down menu. The reading will be indicated on the display.
2. Click on 'Show range in this age group'. Compare the display reading with this range.
3. Find out the patient status (Healthy/ Unhealthy)
4. Repeat steps 2and 3 for various age groups.
5. Now level 3 tab will be activated. Click on this tab to enter in level 3.

### Level 3: Study effect of different types of errors on Biosensor performance

#### Aim: To study effect of Stray light and effect of misalignment on Biosensor Performance

##### Step by step Procedure:

1. Click on Error Tab.
2. Select the type of error for which the performance of sensor is to be studied using drop down menu.
3. For Stray light effect the display reading goes out of range.
4. For effect of misalignment, drag the LED from its centre position in up or down direction and observe the effect on the displayed reading. The initial reading when the sensor is properly aligned; is the same one as displayed in the measurement part.
